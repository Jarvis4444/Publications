# Vulnerability Exposure Driven Intelligence in Smart, Circular Cities
Throughout the final year of my bachelors degree at Bournemouth University myself, my supervisor Prof. Katos and a PhD student A. Damianou worked on an academic paper for [Digital Threats: Research and Practice](https://dl.acm.org/journal/dtrap) journal. The data that I gathered and code I wrote and the results that were returned were used for my dissertation and the final piece of work I did in this degree. 

The work was built upon the [European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA)](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/) and their work on the [state of vulnerabilities](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/technical-reports-on-cybersecurity-situation-the-state-of-cyber-security-vulnerabilities). You can find their more technical work on this specific publication at their [github](https://github.com/enisaeu/vuln-report).
